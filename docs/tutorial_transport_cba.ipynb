    "## 1. What is a CBA\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cost-benefit analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis) (CBA) is a standard method for evaluating the meaningfulness of investments.  \n",
    "An example of its recent use in the context of transport is the UK high speed railway (HS2) [more here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/3651/hs2-economic-case-value-for-money.pdf).  \n",

    "### 1.2. Costs and benefits of a new road\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a new road has two types of costs:\n",
    "1. capital expenditure (CAPEX), ie cost required to build the road\n",
    "2. operation expenditure (OPEX), ie cost of servicing and maintaining the road\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of using a road are of the following kinds:\n",
    "1. Saved travel time. New road often allows higher speeds than the old one.\n",
    "2. Saved operating costs. Eg oil and tyres, which depend on the number of kilometres passes.\n",
    "3. Saved fuel. Depends on speed and number of kilometres passes.\n",
    "4. Reduced accidents due to improved road parameters.\n",
    "5. Reduced noise. Due to bypassing a town.\n",
    "6. Reduced greenhouse gases and harmful emissions (eg PM2.5 or NOx) following from lowered fuel."

    "## 2. What is transport-cba\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of transport-cba is to remove the complexity and time \n",
    "spent on building an overly complex and unwieldy Excel file by defining\n",
    "a clear structure of inputs and automatising the computation.\n",
    " \n",
    "As a result, this frees up time and expenses spent on manual tasks.\n",
    "The freed resources can be focused on most important problems\n",
    "of road planning, among others:\n",
    "* fast and consistent evaluation of many projects in the country and consequent prioritisation\n",
    "* evaluation of several scenarios of the growth of intensities\n",
    "* exploration of different building scenarios (eg change in build time) \n",
    "* and variation of BCR with capital expenditures\n",
    "* exploration of different road routing\n",
    " \n",
    "Although Excel is an extremely useful tool, one of the key \n",
    "functionalities that it cannot provide is consistency and\n",
    "reproducibility. It is not only easy to make an error in the formula,\n",
    "but also deliberately hide a computation and mislead the decision makers.\n",
    "Python, like any programming language, enables im principle to minimise this risk."

    "There are four types of inputs amounting to six tables:\n",
    "1. Parameters of old and new road sections.\n",
